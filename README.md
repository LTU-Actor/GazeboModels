# Ackermann Simulator Vehicle

ROS packages for simulating a vehicle with Ackermann steering

Requires Gazebo simulator to be installed: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_ubuntu&cat=install
Also, you may have to experiment with video drivers. I have good luck with Ubuntu's standard graphics frover (nouveau) on GM108M [GeForce 840M] (rev a2) for one system, and on another nvidia-384 seems to be working well on GP104 [GeForce GTX 1070]. 

## Clone the repository into the src folder (or sub folder) of your catkin workspace.

```git clone https://github.com/LTU-Actor/GazeboSimulatorModel.git```

## Clone the velodyne_simulator into the same src. 

```git clone https://github.com/florianshkurti/velodyne_simulator.git```

## Install needed ackerman packages
```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ackermann-msgs
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ackermann-steering-controller
```

## Make sure controller packages are installed

```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-joint-state-controller  
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-effort-controllers  
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-position-controllers
```

In the main catkin directory, run catkin_make.

You may also need to install libignition-math2-dev to get a file used by the Velodyne plugins, Inertial.hh. If you get the following error:

[workspace]/src/GazeboSimulatorModel/velodyne_gazebo_plugins/src/GazeboRosVelodyneLaser.cpp:35:
/usr/include/gazebo-7/gazebo/msgs/msgs.hh:24:37: fatal error: ignition/math/Inertial.hh: No such file or directory

## Run the following to install the library: 

```
sudo apt-get install libignition-math2-dev
```
## Add the driving course ground plain
Inside the "items" folder is a zip file, course_ground_plane.zip. Unzip and move the folder called course_ground_plan. Move this folder into your gazebo modules folder: ~/.gazebo/modules  

Note: .gazebo is a hidden folder in your home directory. You can unhide hidden folder with Ctrl+h in the file browser. 


## Setup the terminal.

```
source devel/setup.sh
```

## Run either the ackermann vehicle with only the camera, or with LiDAR as well. 

```
roslaunch ackermann_vehicle_gazebo ackermann_vehicle.launch
roslaunch ackermann_vehicle_gazebo ackermann_vehicle_lidar.launch
```
